# Bejeweled-2-Header-Files
The official bejeweled 2 headers from the cutting rrom floor, now as a github repository.
This repository (and its readme) have been modified to have proper Windows Code 1252 CRLF line endings instead of the original mac based, (which is where these headers came from).

There is a ton of nusiances going around as to if EA owns and/or gives two craps about these older games.  The true answer is...no they dont.  In fact, they actually have a github here already, with tons of repositories...

The point of these headers (and quite obviously already provided on the platter), is to give game developers an actual sense of how PopCap made their games.

You will notice the lack of source files.   Why are they not included:

# The reasons for not including the source files:

As you all know, there are hundreds of open repos of SexyAppBase, which includes 1.30, 1.34, PopLib (The recent open one with SDL rendering and platform-agnostic code), so I have decided to not include the cpp files into this repo.

# Why Space cat Lembine?  Why did you not include the source files?

Theyre not available, yet.  And, I would rather see *you*, the end user, make a game (with or without, or with similar headers + sources),  that can be much better, if not trillions of times better.  PopCap's widget based UI system is extremely advanatgeous and can create a lot, if you can find the effort to do so.  This is why these headers are a *reference point* for the end user to look at when dealing with these games.  

# Conclusion
This repository is completely free to the public (especially from the fellows from all of the PopCap Discords and communities + The cutting room floor for finding these discoveries), as the purpose is to breathe new life into some obscure game that gained worldwide fame in 1999-2025.  I had changed my mind about restrictions, and hopefully this can be utilized somehow.  "Second Life" so to speak.  The Zuma header files are already here, but more is coming from other repositories which I will link later.  This includes, decompliations of Zuma, Plants vs zombies, among others.

Enjoy!
